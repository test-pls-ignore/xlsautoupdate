Automatically updates data connections of Excel files


To autorun the script on Windows startup, move the .py file into the following folder:
C:\Users\current_user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\

To ensure that the Python script is actually run and not opened in a text editor the standard app to open .py files needs to be changed.
This is done by right clicking on the Python file -> Opens with -> More Apps -> Look for another app on this PC -> python.exe

If Anaconda is installed, the python.exe can be found in the following directory:
C:\Users\current_user\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\python.exe
